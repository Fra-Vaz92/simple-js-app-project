# Pokedex Project

**Objective**
To create a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches data from an external API and displays it in an interactive manner.
 

**The 5 Ws**
1. Who — Your professional network, as well as potential employers.
2. What — A JavaScript app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which uses an
external API.
3. When — Immediately! The code for the app can always be viewed in a repository like GitHub or GitLab.
4. Where — Potential employers, clients, and collaborators might look at the code directly from your GitHub repository or be directed to your GitHub profile from your
portfolio site (your project from Intro to Frontend Development).
5. Why — For your potential employers, clients, and collaborators to see how you create the architecture of a JavaScript app, as well as how you test and debug your code.

**Features and Requirements**
Core Functionality:
- Load data from an external API (e.g., PokéAPI).
- Display a list of items (e.g., Pokémon).
- Show detailed information for a selected item (e.g., using a modal).

**Technical Requirements:**
