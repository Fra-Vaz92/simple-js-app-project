# Pokedex Project

**Objective**
To create a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches data from an external API and displays it in an interactive manner.
 

**The 5 Ws**
1. Who — Your professional network, as well as potential employers.
2. What — A JavaScript app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which uses an
external API.
3. When — Immediately! The code for the app can always be viewed in a repository like GitHub or GitLab.
4. Where — Potential employers, clients, and collaborators might look at the code directly from your GitHub repository or be directed to your GitHub profile from your
portfolio site (your project from Intro to Frontend Development).
5. Why — For your potential employers, clients, and collaborators to see how you create the architecture of a JavaScript app, as well as how you test and debug your code.

**Features and Requirements**
Core Functionality:
- Load data from an external API (e.g., PokéAPI).
- Display a list of items (e.g., Pokémon).
- Show detailed information for a selected item (e.g., using a modal).

**Technical Requirements:**
- Adherence to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript best practices.
- Use of a CSS framework like Bootstrap for styling.
- Implementation of error handling and loading indicators.
- Deployment to a public platform (e.g., GitHub Pages).

Optional Enhancements:
- Search functionality.
- Pagination for large datasets.
- Offline functionality (e.g., using IndexedDB).

**Project Deliverables**
- HTML structure: Define the basic layout of the application.
- CSS styling: Create a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
- Learn coding practices focusing on the core principles of JavaScript: objects, arrays, conditionals, and loops.
- Set up a general dataset for your application and display it in a very basic way to the user.
- JavaScript logic: Implement core functionalities like data fetching, display, and interactions (IIFE, OOP, Functonal programming, forEach loops)
- Learn about the popular JavaScript library, jQuery.
- Build a basic To-Do-List app using jQuery.
- Use modal function to show data details.
- Use bootstrap framework to enahcne the UI.
- API integration: Consume data from an external API.
- Error handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms.
- Deployment: Deploy the application to a public platform.
- DOM Interaction: render static data from the repository, add basic styling, make the application accessible.
- Javascrit performance and debugging using plugins and best practices through developers Tools. 

**Final Result**:
By completing this project, you'll gain practical experience in web development, API integration, and JavaScript programming.
